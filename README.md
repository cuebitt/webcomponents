# webcomponents

This is a collection of [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components) intended to make sharing modules on [Neocities](https://neocities.org) easier.

# Motivation

Most Neocities sites are handwritten without using a build tool like most other sites. Many sites have elements that are borrowed from other users, such as a hit counter or a music player. Copy-pasting these into an HTML document can make the document harder to read, so using [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components) to make a site more modular increases readability while retaining the DIY-nature of Neocities.

# Usage

See the `README.md` file in each subdirectory in the `components` folder of this repository. You can download the Javascript file and upload it directly to your site, or use a CDN like [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) to include it remotely.

# Attribution
